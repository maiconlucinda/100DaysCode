<p align="center">
  Welcome to my coding adventure! This repository captures my 100-day journey of coding with Python, where I'll be creating a myriad of projects to elevate my Python skills.
</p>
Overview
The heart of this challenge lies in dedicating at least one hour each day to coding, with a focus on diverse Python projects. Join me as I explore various libraries, tackle interesting problems, and cultivate a robust foundation in Python programming.

Project Structure
The repository is thoughtfully organized into folders for each day, such as day-1, day-2, and so forth. Delve into each day's folder to discover:

Code: Elegant Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks that encapsulate the essence of the day's project.
Documentation: A README.md file providing a narrative of the project, detailing challenges faced, and showcasing lessons learned.
Resources: Any additional files or resources essential for a complete understanding of the project.
Getting Started
Fork this repository: Embark on your own 100-day coding journey by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This allows you to curate your progress and exhibit your evolving skills.

Clone your forked repository: Establish a connection between the repository and your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/100-days-of-code-python.git
Create a branch: Unveil the magic of each day by creating a new branch with the following enchanting incantation:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b day-1
Customize "day-1" to correspond to the magical day of your 100-day journey.

Code and commit: Conjure your Python spells on the chosen project for the day. Once satisfied, commit your magical changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Day 1: A glimpse into my magical project"
Push your changes: Propagate your magical changes to your GitHub repository:

bash
Copy code
git push origin day-1
Repeat: Repeat the enchanting steps 3-5 for each day of the magical challenge.
