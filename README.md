100 Days of Code with Python

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code with Python challenge! In this repository, I'll be documenting my coding journey as I embark on a 100-day challenge to enhance my Python programming skills by working on a variety of different projects.

Overview
The primary goal of this challenge is to dedicate at least an hour every day to coding for 100 consecutive days. Each day, I will be working on a unique Python project, exploring various concepts, and pushing myself to become a more proficient Python developer.

Project Structure
The repository is organized into folders for each day (e.g., day-1, day-2, etc.). Within each day's folder, you can expect to find:

Code: Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks for the day's project.
Documentation: A README.md file providing details about the project, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
Resources: Any additional resources or files necessary for the project.
Getting Started
Fork this repository: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This will enable you to track your progress and showcase your work.

Clone your forked repository: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/100-days-of-code-python.git
Create a branch: For each day, create a new branch using the following naming convention:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b day-1
Replace "day-1" with the corresponding day of your 100-day journey.

Code and commit: Start coding on your chosen project for the day. Once you're done, commit your changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Day 1: Brief description of what I worked on"
Push your changes: Push your changes to your GitHub repository:

bash
Copy code
git push origin day-1
Repeat: Repeat steps 3-5 for each day of the challenge.

Resources
Throughout this challenge, I'll be utilizing various resources to enhance my learning. Some recommendations include:

Python Documentation
Real Python
Codecademy - Learn Python
Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
Conclusion
By the end of this 100-day journey, I aim to have a diverse portfolio of Python projects and a deeper understanding of the language. Here's to a successful and rewarding coding journey! Happy coding!
