#Day 1 - Beginner - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

#Print Function
print("Hello World!")



#String can be seen as a pearl necklace, double quotes show the beginning and the end of that string.



#Using backslash and the letter n, we get our output printed on two separeted lines.
print("Hello world!\nHello world!")



#Using + we can combine strings (string concatnation)
print("Hello " + "Hello")
print("Hello" + " " + "Hello")



#Function input, allow the user to type in some piece of data, aftwards we can use that piece of data
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))



#Len function allow you to calculate the length of a string.
print("Type a string and get the number of letters it has:")
print(len(input()))



#Variables, allow us to add data to a name
name = input("what is your name?")
print(name)



#naming variables, there some rules that we have to follow.
